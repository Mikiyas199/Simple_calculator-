# Simple_calculator-
 A simple, responsive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Supports basic math operations, light/dark mode, and a small history panel. 

This is a basic calculator I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It handles simple math operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Nothing too fancy — just a clean, responsive design and a functional layout. You can use the buttons or your keyboard to input numbers. I also added some simple styling to make it look modern and mobile-friendly.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷)
- Responsive layout (works on phones too)
- Supports both button clicks and keyboard input
- "Clear" and "Backspace" functions
- Light footer with my name

## Files

- `index.html` – main layout and structure
- `style.css` – styles for the calculator
- `script.js` – logic behind the buttons and operations
